          Why Simple Not Simpler? Some solutions are too complicated which
          result in unnecessary expense. Some solutions are too simple and don't
          achieve the goal. I try to balance these extremes by keeping in mind
          this bit of wisdom I found (often attributed to Einsten): "Everything
          Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler".
